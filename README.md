# How Would You Describe Yourself?

## So, I want to tell you some words about me:-)

I believe that I’m a reliable and result-oriented person. In addition to my programming experience and my engineering expertise, I have worked on several projects of multiple sizes and complexity levels during my career. 
My creativity has made me an effective team leader because I can anticipate problems and innovate solutions. My ability to work alongside other assertive individuals allows me to find balance by offering innovative, on-the-spot ideas that can help my colleagues better achieve their goals.

## What else?

I enjoy reading detectives, but I hate romantic stories))) . I think it’s just a waste of time. And of course I like music! I'm fond of music of the 60-80s, like the the Rolling Stones and Elvis Prestly.
